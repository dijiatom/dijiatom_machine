### Dijiatom Working principle
First, dijiatom machine reads the <projectname>.dja file. Then It begins to interpret the file it reads from the label called Neutron and activates the proton or neutron nucleus it has determined in it. Variables and functions are determined in the working proton nucleus, and the electron of the same name activates the nucleus. In the electron core, the main function and other functions are written and executed.
